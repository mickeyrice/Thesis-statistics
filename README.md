Neural Correlates of Prospective Memory for College Students with Anxiety 

The aim of this thesis was to examine if increased anxiety levels predicted decreased prospecitve memory performance, and if brain activity, measured from two event-related potentials, could explain this relationship.

I used correlations to test a relationship between prospective memory accuracy and reaction time (Accuracy, RT), anxiety levels (BAI, STAIT, STAIS), and two event-related potential (N300, PP). Once correlations were established, I ran a mediation analysis. 

Additionally, I tested how other variables (sleep, ADHD, depression, affect, motivation, executive function) may play a role in the overall anxiety-prospective memory relationship. 

I created graphs and tables to include in my thesis.
